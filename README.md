# Blog-Comments

Comments for my blog [brightprogrammer.in](https://brightprogrammer.in). Disqus was good but then I got an email that ads will start. I really like the Disqus interface, but sadly I don't want my readers watching ads, or any other ad-tracking from my side, even if it's induced by some third-party app I use. At least I don't want to do all that to the extent of my conscious knowledge.

Gisqus comes to save the day. The comments are saved as issues here.
